# Orchestrator
## Overview
- The main goal of this project is to use Kubernetes to deploy and manage a microservices architecture built on top of a K3s cluster. It includes a variety of services, such as databases, applications, and an API gateway. The application images for this project are derived from my earlier work, "crud-master-py," which provided a strong foundation for developing these services. Through this project, I have gained a thorough understanding of Kubernetes resources, including StatefulSets, services, deployments, Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA), Persistent Volumes (PV), Persistent Volume Claims (PVC), and secrets. The project also emphasizes the significance of secure credential handling using Kubernetes secrets and infrastructure as code (IaC). The outcome is a robust and scalable microservices environment that has enhanced my ability to tackle real-world DevOps challenges.
